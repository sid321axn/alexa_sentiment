# alexa_sentiment
In this project I ahve developed a machine learning model  to classify Amazon's product Alexa's Reviews collected from 10000 realtime customers of amazon to be positive or negative. Based on the customers reviews who have purchased the product, I have classified the reviews into positive or negative based on the sentiments showing in their reviews (Sentiment Analysis).
